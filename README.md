# Pull Request Demo

To practice creating a Pull Request, here's what you'll need to do:

1. Fork this repository
2. Push a commit to that repository including a file with your name on it
3. Create a pull request between your repo and this repo to merge that commit
4. Wait for an instructor to review your changes :)

Sounds good? Give it a try!
